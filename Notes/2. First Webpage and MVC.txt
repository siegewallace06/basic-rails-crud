> Gemfile
gemfile is a file that contains a list of gems that are 
required for the application to run. 
It is used by the Bundler gem to install all the required 
gems for the application. 
It is also used by the Rails framework to load all 
the required gems for the application to run.

Generators
===========================
Generators are used to create files and folders in the
application.

rails generate controller <controller_name>
rails generate model <model_name> <column_name>:<column_type>
rails generate scaffold <model_name> <column_name>:<column_type>

let's create a home controller with index file
rails generate controller home index

# Defines the root path route ("/")
root 'home#index'

get list of routes
rails routes
