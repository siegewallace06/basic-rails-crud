Generate Scaffolds
==========================
In rails, Scaffolds is a way to generate a set of files that will allow you 
to perform CRUD operations on a model. It will generate a controller, views, and a model. 
It will also generate a migration file that will create the table in the database. 
The scaffold generator will also add the necessary routes to the routes.rb file.

To generate a scaffold, you can use the following command:
rails g scaffold <model_name> <field_name>:<field_type> <field_name>:<field_type> ...

Let's create a scaffold for friends.
We will need First Name, Last Name,Email Address, Phone, and Twitter.
rails g scaffold Friend first_name:string last_name:string email:string phone:string twitter:string

This will generate a lot of files. Let's take a look at the files that were generated.
app/controllers/friends_controller.rb
Above is the controller for the friends model. It will contain the CRUD operations for the model.

app/models/friend.rb
This is the model for the friends model. It will contain the validations for the model.

app/views/friends
This is the folder that contains the views for the friends model. 
It will contain the views for the CRUD operations.

db/migrate/20130313191100_create_friends.rb
This is the migration file that will create the table in the database.

test/fixtures/friends.yml
This is the file that will contain the fixtures for the friends model.

test/functional/friends_controller_test.rb
This is the test file for the friends controller.

test/unit/friend_test.rb
This is the test file for the friends model.

After that we run this command to create the table in the database.
rails db:migrate
