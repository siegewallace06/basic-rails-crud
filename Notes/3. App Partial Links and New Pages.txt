Links
============================
So everything for the header is stored at app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

Here we will try to create about page without Generator.

1. Create a new file in app/views/home called about.html.erb
2. Go to app/controllers/home_controller.rb and add a new method called about
3. Go to config/routes.rb and add a new route for about page

Now we can go to http://localhost:3000/about and see the about page.

============================
Bootstrap
============================
Bootstrap is a front-end framework for faster and easier web development. 
It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, 
tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, 
as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

We will use the CDN version of Bootstrap.
get it here:

============================
Partials
============================
Partials are a way to break up your views into smaller pieces that can be reused in other views.

1. Create a new file in app/views/home called _header.html.erb
2. Add the embedded ruby code for the header:
<%= render 'home/header' %>

We will use the Navbar component from Bootstrap.

============================
Links
============================
To create link to home page we will use the link_to helper method:
  <%= link_to "Friend List", root_path, class = "navbar-brand" %>

============================
Conclusions
============================
We have created a simple web application using Ruby on Rails.

The Application erb file is the main layout file for the application.
To create Partials we use the _file_name.html.erb naming convention.
We can use the link_to helper method to create links to other pages.
We can use the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive web application.
